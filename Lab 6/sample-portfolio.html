            <p>The To-Do List Application allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app enables simple task management where users can organize their daily activities, set deadlines, and track progress. The tasks can be saved locally in the browser using LocalStorage or through a backend system that stores tasks in a database. The application typically features a clean, minimalist UI with options to categorize tasks (e.g., "Work", "Personal") and sort them based on priority or due date.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify images into predefined categories (e.g., animals, digits, etc.). The model uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to process and classify images. After training the model on a labeled dataset, it can predict the class of new images with high accuracy. The project demonstrates proficiency in neural networks, image processing, and model evaluation.</p>

            <p>The Movie Recommendation System leverages machine learning algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. It uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend movies similar to those the user has already rated highly. Users can input their ratings for movies, and the system will output personalized recommendations. The backend is powered by Python, and the frontend is built using React, providing a smooth user experience. The database stores movie data and user preferences.</p>
